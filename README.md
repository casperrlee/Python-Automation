# Python-Automation

All of these are examples of processes that were automated using python.

1. Budget Automation - Creates an excel file with latest transactions from all of your bank accounts (ex. Bank of America).

2. Download Report (Daily) - Logs into a reporting website (bypasses 2-Factor Authentication), downloads the needed report, and sends it to SQL database.

3. File Transfer (Weekly) - Searches through the Downloads folder for the latest downloaded report, creates new files in the correct destination folder, and sends previous week's files to Archived folder.

4. Data Cleansing (Monthly) - Receives third-party dataset of over 10,000 lines in excel and uses product title to fill in necessary information for business processes. (This processs was originally being done manually by another department).
